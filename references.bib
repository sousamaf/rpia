  abstract      = {5G and edge computing will serve various emerging use cases that have diverse requirements of multiple resources, e.g., radio, transportation, and computing. Network slicing is a promising technology for creating virtual networks that can be customized according to the requirements of different use cases. Provisioning network slices requires end-to-end resource orchestration which is challenging. In this paper, we design a decentralized resource orchestration system named EdgeSlice for dynamic end-to-end network slicing. EdgeSlice introduces a new decentralized deep reinforcement learning (D-DRL) method to efficiently orchestrate end-to-end resources. D-DRL is composed of a performance coordinator and multiple orchestration agents. The performance coordinator manages the resource orchestration policies in all the orchestration agents to ensure the service level agreement (SLA) of network slices. The orchestration agent learns the resource demands of network slices and orchestrates the resource allocation accordingly to optimize the performance of the slices under the constrained networking and computing resources. We design radio, transport and computing manager to enable dynamic configuration of end-to-end resources at runtime. We implement EdgeSlice on a prototype of the end-to-end wireless edge computing network with OpenAirInterface LTE network, OpenDayLight SDN switches, and CUDA GPU platform. The performance of EdgeSlice is evaluated through both experiments and trace-driven simulations. The evaluation results show that EdgeSlice achieves much improvement as compared to baseline in terms of performance, scalability, compatibility.},

  abstract      = {Fifth Generation (5G) networks are envisioned to be fully autonomous in accordance to the ETSI-defined Zero touch network and Service Management (ZSM) concept. To this end, purpose-specific Machine Learning (ML) models can be used to manage and control physical as well as virtual network resources in a way that is fully compliant to slice Service Level Agreements (SLAs), while also boosting the revenue of the underlying physical network operator(s). This is because specially designed and trained ML models can be both proactive and very effective against slice management issues that can induce significant SLA penalties or runtime costs. However, reaching that point is very challenging. 5G networks will be highly dynamic and complex, offering a large scale of heterogeneous, sophisticated and resource-demanding 5G services as network slices. This raises a need for a well-defined, generic and step-wise roadmap to designing, building and deploying efficient ML models as collaborative components of what can be defined as Cognitive Network and Slice Management (CNSM) 5G systems. To address this need, we take a use case-driven approach to design and present a novel Integrated Methodology for CNSM in virtualized 5G networks based on a concrete eHealth use case, and elaborate on it to derive a generic approach for 5G slice management use cases. The three fundamental components that comprise our proposed methodology include (i) a 5G Cognitive Workflow model that conditions everything from the design up to the final deployment of ML models; (ii) a Four-stage approach to Cognitive Slice Management with an emphasis on anomaly detection; and (iii) a Proactive Control Scheme for the collaboration of different ML models targeting different slice life-cycle management problems.},

  abstract  = {A sophisticated and efficient network slicing architecture is needed to support the orchestration of network slices across multiple administrative domains. Such multi-domain architecture shall be agnostic of the underlying virtualization and network infrastructure technologies. Its objective is to extend the traditional orchestration, management and control capabilities by means of models and constructs in order to form a well-stitched composition of network slices. To facilitate such a composition of networking and compute/storage resources, this article introduces a management and orchestration architecture that incorporates Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) components to the basic 3GPP network slice management. The proposed architecture is broadly divided into four major strata, namely the Multi-domain Service Conductor Stratum, Domain-specific Fully- Fledged Orchestration Stratum, Sub-Domain MANO and Connectivity Stratum, and Logical Multi-domain Slice Instance stratum. Each of these strata is described in detail, providing the fundamental operational specifics for instantiating and managing the resulting federated network slices.},

One interesting vertical industry, for example, is professional audio production which requires strict synchronization of devices to function. The chapter discusses the significance of network slicing for the support of the vertical industry services. It examines a number of other issues that impact the vertical services such as virtual network function placement, multi-access edge computing, and artificial intelligence. The chapter further presents an overview of the key concepts discussed in the subsequent chapters of this book. The book examines the impact of 5G cellular communications on the various vertical industries.},

In this article, we present a cautionary perspective on the use of AI/ML in the 5G context by highlighting the adversarial dimension spanning multiple types of ML (supervised/unsupervised/RL) and support this through three case studies. We also discuss approaches to mitigate this adversarial ML risk, offer guidelines for evaluating the robustness of ML models, and call attention to issues surrounding ML oriented research in 5G more generally.},

UAVs are now subject to constraints of area coverage, battery capacity and network quality of service, making their path planning more challenging. In this paper, we formulate the issue as a combinatorial optimization problem which minimizes the flight cost of multiple UAVs covering the entire area. We show this problem is NP-hard, therefore we propose a Particle Swarm Optimization heuristic along with path encoding and local search techniques to solve the problem. Our numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and how the size of the area and D2D link affect the number of UAVs needed and their flight time.},

  abstract  = {With the booming development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and communication technologies such as 5G, our future world is envisioned as an interconnected entity where billions of devices will provide uninterrupted service to our daily lives and the industry. Meanwhile, these devices will generate massive amounts of valuable data at the network edge, calling for not only instant data processing but also intelligent data analysis in order to fully unleash the potential of the edge big data. Both the traditional cloud computing and on-device computing cannot sufficiently address this problem due to the high latency and the limited computation capacity, respectively. Fortunately, the emerging edge computing sheds a light on the issue by pushing the data processing from the remote network core to the local network edge, remarkably reducing the latency and improving the efficiency. Besides, the recent breakthroughs in deep learning have greatly facilitated the data processing capacity, enabling a thrilling development of novel applications, such as video surveillance and autonomous driving. The convergence of edge computing and deep learning is believed to bring new possibilities to both interdisciplinary researches and industrial applications. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the latest efforts on the deep-learning-enabled edge computing applications and particularly offer insights on how to leverage the deep learning advances to facilitate edge applications from four domains, i.e., smart multimedia, smart transportation, smart city, and smart industry. We also highlight the key research challenges and promising research directions therein. We believe this survey will inspire more researches and contributions in this promising field.},

  abstract = {Driven by the emergence of new compute-intensive applications and the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is foreseen that the emerging 5G network will face an unprecedented increase in traffic volume and computation demands. However, end users mostly have limited storage capacities and finite processing capabilities, thus how to run compute-intensive applications on resource-constrained users has recently become a natural concern. Mobile edge computing (MEC), a key technology in the emerging fifth generation (5G) network, can optimize mobile resources by hosting compute-intensive applications, process large data before sending to the cloud, provide the cloud-computing capabilities within the radio access network (RAN) in close proximity to mobile users, and offer context-aware services with the help of RAN information. Therefore, MEC enables a wide variety of applications, where the real-time response is strictly required, e.g., driverless vehicles, augmented reality, robotics, and immerse media. Indeed, the paradigm shift from 4G to 5G could become a reality with the advent of new technological concepts. The successful realization of MEC in the 5G network is still in its infancy and demands for constant efforts from both academic and industry communities. In this survey, we first provide a holistic overview of MEC technology and its potential use cases and applications. Then, we outline up-to-date researches on the integration of MEC with the new technologies that will be deployed in 5G and beyond. We also summarize testbeds and experimental evaluations, and open source activities, for edge computing. We further summarize lessons learned from state-of-the-art research works as well as discuss challenges and potential future directions for MEC research.},

  abstract      = {The paper presents a reinforcement learning solution to dynamic resource allocation for 5G radio access network slicing. Available communication resources (frequency-time blocks and transmit powers) and computational resources (processor usage) are allocated to stochastic arrivals of network slice requests. Each request arrives with priority (weight), throughput, computational resource, and latency (deadline) requirements, and if feasible, it is served with available communication and computational resources allocated over its requested duration. As each decision of resource allocation makes some of the resources temporarily unavailable for future, the myopic solution that can optimize only the current resource allocation becomes ineffective for network slicing. Therefore, a Q-learning solution is presented to maximize the network utility in terms of the total weight of granted network slicing requests over a time horizon subject to communication and computational constraints. Results show that reinforcement learning provides major improvements in the 5G network utility relative to myopic, random, and first come first served solutions. While reinforcement learning sustains scalable performance as the number of served users increases, it can also be effectively used to assign resources to network slices when 5G needs to share the spectrum with incumbent users that may dynamically occupy some of the frequency-time blocks.},

Specifically, we develop a method to search for stable and discriminative features by jointly analyzing mobile app traffic characteristics and assessing the degree of feature drift. Along these lines, we first analyze the in-flow behavior characteristics of traffic flows, so as to extract a potential feature set for mobile app traffic data. Next, we present two new metrics to assess the degree of drift experienced by the flow features from different perspectives and design a composite metric to score these features by considering the degree of drift as a penalty factor of discrimination power. Based on these metrics, we further propose an algorithm to search for optimal features with high discrimination power but low degree of drift. Existing flow features and feature selection algorithms were implemented for our comparison experiments. Our experimental results on real mobile app traffic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our feature set and feature selection algorithm on improving classification robustness.},

  abstract = {5G mobile network technology promises to deliver unprecedented ultra-low latency and high data rates, paving the way for many novel applications and services. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) are two of the technologies that are expected to play a pivotal role in 5G to achieve ambitious Quality of Service requirements of such applications. While NFV provides flexibility by enabling network functions to be dynamically deployed and inter-connected to realize Service Function Chains (SFC), MEC brings the computing capability to the edges of the mobile network thus reducing latency and alleviating the transport network load. However, adequate mechanisms are needed to meet the dynamically changing network service demands, to optimally utilize the network resources while, at the same time, making sure that the end-to-end latency requirement of services is always satisfied. In this work, we first propose machine learning models, in particular neural-networks, that can perform auto-scaling by predicting the required number of virtual network function instances based on the traffic demand, using the traffic traces collected over a real-operator commercial network. We then employ Integer Linear Programming (ILP) techniques to formulate and solve a joint user association and SFC placement problem, where each SFC represents a service requested by a user with end-to-end latency and data rate requirements. Finally, we propose a heuristic to address the scalability concern of the ILP model.},

A proper traffic monitoring solution requires the accurate and timely collection of flow statistics. Many approaches have been proposed to monitor Software-Defined Networks. However, these approaches have some disadvantages. First, they are unconcerned about the trade-off between probing interval and Monitoring Accuracy (MA). Second, they lack intelligent mechanisms intended to optimize this trade-off by learning from network behavior. This paper introduces an approach, called IPro, to address these shortcomings. Our approach comprises an architecture based on the Knowledge-Defined Networking paradigm, an algorithm based on Reinforcement Learning, and an IPro prototype. In particular, IPro uses Reinforcement Learning to determine the probing interval that keeps Control Channel Overhead (CCO) and the Extra CPU Usage of the Controller (CUC) within thresholds. An extensive quantitative evaluation corroborates that IPro is an efficient approach for SDN Monitoring regarding CCO, CCU, and MA.},

  abstract  = {Network Function Virtualization enables network operators to modernize their networks with greater elasticity, network programmability, and scalability. Exploiting these advantages requires new and specialized designs for management, automation, and orchestration systems which are capable of reliably operating and handling new elements such as virtual functions, virtualized infrastructures, and a whole new set of relationships among them. Operations such as resource allocation, instantiation, monitoring, scaling, or termination of virtual functions are key lifecycle operations that NFV management and orchestration (NFV-MANO) frameworks need to correctly perform. Failures of the NFV-MANO prevent the network ability to respond to new service requests or events related to the normal lifecycle operation of network services. Thus, it is important to ensure robustness and high availability of the MANO framework. This paper adopts a model-driven approach to predict the availability of the NFV-MANO and assess the impact that different failure modes have. We propose different models, based on Stochastic Activity Networks (SANs), which abstract various MANO deployment configurations, inspired by current containerized open-source MANO implementations. Moreover, we integrate software rejuvenation and investigate the trade-off between its associated overhead and system availability increase. An extensive experimental campaign with fault-injection techniques on a real-life MANO implementation allows to derive a number of realistic recovery parameters. The case studies are used to quantitatively evaluate the steady-state availability and identify the most important parameters influencing system availability for the different deployment configurations.},
